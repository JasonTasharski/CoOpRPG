# CoOpRPG
Work in progress - will eventually be a text-based RPG for two players (sitting next to each other).

At present:
  Bootstrap added;
  p1 and p2 objects exist;;
  Clicking buttons changes things on the html page;
  The play() error has been resolved;
  A function exists that can change exactly one stat at a time.
To do:
  Removing play3() kills play2() for some reason; fix.
  Make it possible to change things in p1 and p2 somehow.
  Figure out how to add and remove rows and their contents on html-side, instead of just changing what's in a p.
  Everything else.
