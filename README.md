# CoOpRPG
Work in progress - will eventually be a text-based RPG for two players (sitting next to each other).

At present:
  Bootstrap added
  p1 and p2 objects exist
  Clicking buttons changes things on the html page.
To do:
  Figure out how to add and remove rows and their contents on html-side, instead of just changing what's in a p.
  Everything else.
