# CoOpRPG
Work in progress - will eventually be a text-based RPG for two players (sitting next to each other).
It will stay a single-page app - with documentation/about/links on different pages, I guess.
Maybe make a separate splash page?

At present:
  Bootstrap added;
  p1 and p2 objects exist;;
  Clicking buttons changes things on the html page;
  The play() error has been resolved;
  One function changes any stat by increment of 1
  Functions set player names., age, and pronouns
  A function is in progress to alter equipment
  The function that alters equipment works
  Display/hide player information works
To do:
  Make equipment objects?
  Implement multiple states:
    Play? state (both players click PLAY, goes to...)
    Make Characters state (interface with buttons to:
      Increase/reduce stats
      Get/drop equipment (off a list)
      Set name
      Set age
      Set adjectives?
        One positive description, one negative?
      Set social class/role)
    Game states (actual gameplay)
  Implement icons?
  Header?
  Implement social class/role
  	(Determines what NPCs expect of you)
  	(Dependent on stats, equipment, age)
